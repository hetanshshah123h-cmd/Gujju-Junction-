  <h2>About Gujju Junction</h2>
  <p style="text-align:center; max-width:750px; margin:auto;">
    Gujju Junction began as a small home kitchen with one simple idea —
    to serve food that feels like home.
    <br><br>
    Every meal is prepared with patience, traditional recipes,
    and the kind of care that only home cooking can offer.
    No rush, no shortcuts — just honest Gujarati food.
