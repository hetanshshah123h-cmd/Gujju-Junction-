  <h1>About Gujju Junction</h1>
  <p>
    Gujju Junction began in a warm home kitchen with a simple idea —
    to serve food that feels familiar, comforting, and real.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rooted in Gujarati traditions, every meal is prepared with patience,
    care, and recipes passed down through generations. No shortcuts,
    no factory cooking — just honest food made the way it’s cooked at home.
  </p>
  <p>
    From our home in Mira Road–Bhayandar to your plate,
    Gujju Junction is where taste meets emotion.
